<h1>Meet Ntsoaki Brenda Malefo!</h1>
<p>Hi there! I am Brenda, a passionate learner and aspiring Data Scientist and Full-Stack Web Developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering </p>

<p>My journey started in the world of engineering, where I discovered how much I enjoy solving complex problems and creating practical solutions. That same curiosity led me to explore the world of data and technology, where I am now building my skills in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learning how to turn data and code into something meaningful. I hold a certificate in Data Analytics.</p>

<p>I am currently studying Data Science and Full-Stack Web Development, and this website is my first step into showcasing what I am learning and creating along the way. I love exploring new ideas, improving my skills every day, and challenging myself to grow both personally and professionally.</p>

<p>When I am not coding or analyzing data, you will probably find me brainstorming new project ideas or learning something new that helps me become better at what I do.</p>
